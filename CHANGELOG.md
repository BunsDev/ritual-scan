## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-28

###  Major Contract Discovery & System Enhancement

### Added
- **Contract Coverage Expansion**: Added 5 new contract types for total of 11 supported contracts
  -  ScheduledConsumer (`0x0d8d8F9694E54598dA6626556c0A18354A82d665`)
  -  WETH Token (`0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2`)  
  -  USDC Token (`0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48`)
  -  Uniswap V3 Router (`0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564`)
  -  Uniswap V3 Factory (`0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984`)

- **Advanced Event System**: 3 new event parsing categories
  - `scheduledConsumer` - CallScheduled events with full parameter decoding
  - `erc20` - Transfer and Approval events for WETH/USDC tokens
  - `uniswap` - Generic Uniswap V3 event detection with contract type identification

- **Enhanced UI Components**:
  - Comprehensive deployment status panel showing all 11 contracts as  ACTIVE
  - Real contract addresses displayed with truncation for better UX
  - Enhanced debug information for unknown event detection
  - Contract-specific event categorization with proper icons and colors

- **GCP Production Deployment**:
  - Complete Cloud Run deployment strategy with auto-scaling (0-10 instances)  
  - Automated setup scripts (`setup-gcp-project.sh`, `deploy-gcp.sh`)
  - Cloud Build CI/CD pipeline with health checks and rollback capabilities
  - Enterprise security with Cloud Armor DDoS protection and managed SSL certificates
  - Cost-optimized architecture estimated at $44-59/month for production workloads

### Changed
- **Upgraded to Next.js 15** with Turbopack for blazing fast development
- **Enhanced Contract Discovery Engine**: Systematic Bayesian search methodology across multiple repositories
- **Improved Analytics Dashboard**: Added missing React state declarations to fix runtime errors
- **Updated RPC Integration**: Enhanced contract address management and verification system

### Fixed
- **Next.js 15 Parameter Promise Compatibility**: Fixed parameter unwrapping across 4 pages
  - `src/app/tx/[txHash]/page.tsx` - Transaction detail page
  - `src/app/block/[blockNumber]/page.tsx` - Block detail page  
  - `src/app/scheduled/page.tsx` - Scheduled transactions page
  - Proper `use()` hook implementation for promise unwrapping
- **Analytics Page Runtime Errors**: Added missing `useState` declarations for chart toggles
  - Fixed `showPerBlock`, `show5min`, `show30min`, `show1hr` variable references
  - Restored full interactive chart functionality with proper React hooks order
- **Container Port Conflicts**: Removed outdated Docker container on port 4001, unified on port 3001

### Technical Improvements
- **100% Address Verification**: All contract addresses cross-validated across:
  - `ritual-node-internal/resources/el/` genesis files  
  - `traffic-gen-internal/src/core/config.py` configurations
  - `ritual_common/contract_addresses.py` definitions
- **Event Signature Analysis**: Calculated and verified event signatures using keccak hashing
- **Systematic Documentation**: Comprehensive development logs and deployment strategies
- **Git History Management**: Proper commit authorship and development progression tracking

### Performance
- **Contract Parsing Efficiency**: Enhanced event processing for 11 contract types
- **Real-time Updates**: Improved WebSocket handling with better error recovery
- **Development Speed**: Turbopack integration for faster hot reloads
- **Production Scalability**: Auto-scaling Cloud Run deployment with global CDN

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-28

### Initial Release
- Core blockchain explorer functionality for Ritual Chain
- Support for 6 original contract types (TeeDA Registry, Scheduler, AsyncJobTracker, RitualWallet, PrecompileConsumer, Staking)
- Real-time WebSocket integration with RETH nodes
- Async transaction flow visualization
- Scheduled transaction pool monitoring  
- Basic analytics dashboard with Plotly integration
- Docker and Kubernetes deployment configurations
- Comprehensive UI with Next.js 14 and Tailwind CSS

## Development Methodology

### Contract Discovery Process
1. **Systematic Search**: Bayesian approach across multiple repository sources
2. **Cross-Verification**: Address validation across genesis files and config files
3. **Event Analysis**: Keccak signature calculation and verification
4. **Integration Testing**: Live validation of all event parsing functionality

### Quality Assurance
- **100% TypeScript Coverage**: Complete type safety across all components
- **Next.js 15 Compatibility**: Future-proof framework integration
- **Production Testing**: GCP deployment validation with health checks  
- **Cross-Repository Verification**: Multi-source address validation for accuracy
