# Ritual Scan - Feature Roadmap & Priority Stack Rank

Based on analysis of the codebase, newly enabled admin APIs, and user value.

## 🏆 TIER 1: HIGH IMPACT, NOW POSSIBLE (Admin API Enabled)

### 1. ⭐ **Real Network Topology Visualization** 
**Impact:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 | **Difficulty:** 🟢 Medium | **Status:** Ready to implement

**What:** Replace placeholder validator map with **real peer discovery and geographic visualization**

**Why Now:**
- Admin API (`admin_peers`) now enabled - gives us actual IPs!
- ValidatorNetworkMap component exists but uses fake locations
- Unique differentiator for Ritual Scan vs other explorers

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// backend/api/network/peers/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  const peers = await rethClient.adminPeers()
  const geoData = await enrichWithGeoIP(peers)
  return Response.json(geoData)
}

// Update ValidatorNetworkMap.tsx to use real data
const peerLocations = await fetch('/api/network/peers')
// Plot actual lat/long instead of placeholder regions
```

**Features:**
- Real IP addresses from all connected peers
- GeoIP lookup (MaxMind GeoLite2) for lat/long
- Live connections between validators (full mesh for Summit BFT)
- Click node to see peer details (enode, protocols, capabilities)
- Color by block production / validation activity
- Animated pulses for active connections

**User Value:** See **actual** network topology, not simulated

### 2. 🌐 **Network Health Dashboard**
**Impact:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥 | **Difficulty:** 🟢 Easy | **Status:** Ready to implement

**What:** Dedicated page showing network health metrics from admin APIs

**Why Now:**
- Admin APIs give us peer count, connection status
- Users want to know if network is healthy

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// app/network/page.tsx
- Total peer count (admin_nodeInfo, admin_peers)
- Connection quality metrics
- Geographic distribution
- Protocol version distribution

- Consensus participation rate
- Validator uptime tracking
```

**Features:**

- Connected since (duration)
- Protocols supported (eth/68, eth/67, etc.)
- Last seen block
- Latency (if available)

// app/peer/[peerId]/page.tsx
// Detailed peer view
```

**Features:**
- Search peers by ID, IP, or location
